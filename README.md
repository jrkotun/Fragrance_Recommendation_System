## Project Overview
The Fragrance Recommendation System is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that helps users discover fragrances tailored to their preferences. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining efficient similarity search in a FAISS vector space with natural language explanations generated by a large language model (Ollama).

User queries and fragrance profiles are represented as vectors; cosine similarity is used to identify the most relevant fragrance matches. FAISS enables fast and scalable retrieval from the fragrance database. For each recommendation, the app provides a clear, user-friendly explanation generated by Ollama, making the selection process transparent and interpretable.

This approach empowers users to navigate the complex world of perfumes with personalized, explainable recommendations.

## Live Demo
Check out the deployed app on Hugging Face Spaces:

## Key Features
- Natural language search: Enter your preferences like "fresh scent for springtime" or "dark, woody scent for evening wear" or a more complex query.
- Semantic embedding: Converts fragrance metadata into text and embeds them using a Sentence Transformer model.
- FAISS-powered retrieval: Fast nearest-neighbor search across thousands of fragrances.
- Structured filters: Refine results by brand, gender, rating, accords, or specific notes.
- LLM-generated rationale: Uses Ollama to explain why a particular fragrance was recommended.
- Fragrance cards: Displays perfume details with brand, perfumers, notes, accords, and the Ollama explanation.

## Project Structure
- Fragrance_Recommender.ipynb: Main notebook, contains the code to read in the fragrance data, create the FAISS index, and create the streamlit app.
- fra_cleaned.csv: Cleaned dataset with fragrance metadata
- fragrance_faiss.index: FAISS vector index
- fragrance_metadata.pkl: Fragrance metadata
- fragrance_recommendation_app.py: Main Streamlit application
- README.md: Project Documentation

## Dataset
Utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that was originally scraped from Fragrantica.com and contains information on over 24,000 fragrances.
Dataset includes the following information for each fragrance:
- Fragrance name, house, country, release year
- Gender classification
- Ratings and review count
- Note pyramid (top, middle, base)
- Accords (e.g., citrus, amber, woody)
- Perfumer(s)
